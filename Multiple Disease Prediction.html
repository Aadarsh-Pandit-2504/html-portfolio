<h1>Multiple Disease Prediction using Machine Learning</h1>
<p>This project is a made to predict four diseases namely <b>Diabetes,Heart Disease, Parkinson's Disease and Liver Disease.</b>
    The Machine Learning Algorithms used here are<b>SVM(Support Vector Machine),KNN(Kth Nearest Neighbour),LR(Logistic Regression) and RF(Random Forest).</b>
    The accuracies obtained for various diseases are<b>100%,90%,100% and 97%</b> respectively.
