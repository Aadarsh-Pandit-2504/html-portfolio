<p>Hello My Name is Aadarsh Pandit 2024 graduate form Vivekanand Education Society's Institute of TechnologyI have completed my Engineering in Electronics and Telecommunication Stream.
   Currently looking for a job as a Software Engineer or a Web Developer.I have a keen intrest in Web Development field and I am learning HTML,CSS and Javascript.
   I have made 2 projects Web Development projects using HTML.

<p><b>1.Multiple Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning</b></p>
  <p>  This project is a made to predict four diseases namely <b>Diabetes,Heart Disease, Parkinson's Disease and Liver Disease.</b>
    The Machine Learning Algorithms used here are<b>SVM(Support Vector Machine),KNN(Kth Nearest Neighbour),LR(Logistic Regression) and RF(Random Forest).</b>
    The accuracies obtained for various diseases are<b>100%,90%,100% and 97%</b> respectively.
</p>

<p><b>2. Fake News Prediction using Machine Learning</b></p>
 <p>  This project is based on classifying the news as true or false. The algorithm used here is <b>Passive Aggressive classifier</b> which efficiently classifies the news as true or fake depending on various attributes. It matches the data with relevant facts and give the required correct output. 
    Accuracy obtained was <b>95%.</b>
